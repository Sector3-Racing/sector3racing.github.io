## Deployment

The site is deployed using GitHub Pages.

### How it works

1. The repository follows the GitHub Pages naming convention:
<username>.github.io


2. GitHub automatically builds and serves the site from the `main` branch
3. DNS records point the custom domain to GitHub Pages
4. HTTPS is provisioned automatically

No CI pipeline or manual deployment steps are required.

## Local Development

You can preview the site locally by opening `index.html` directly in a browser.

No local server or tooling is necessary.

---

## Customization

To update site content:
- Edit text directly in `index.html`
- Adjust colors, fonts, or layout in `style.css`

Common updates include:
- Driver roster
- Racing programs
- Partner listings
- Contact information
- Visual branding refinements

---

## Design Philosophy

- Motorsport-first visual language
- Minimalist, high-contrast layout
- Performance over ornamentation
- Intentional restraint over excess features

The site is designed to feel closer to paddock signage than a marketing landing page.

---

## Future Expansion

The current architecture supports future growth without requiring a rebuild.

Potential additions include:
- Results and calendar pages
- Media and press assets
- Partner-specific sections
- Static site generators such as Astro or Eleventy
- Migration to alternative free hosting providers

All of the above can be implemented incrementally.
